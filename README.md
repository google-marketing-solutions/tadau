## Problem
Currently, there is a lack of a standardized approach to monitor usage data for
gTech Ads solutions hosted on open-source platforms such as GitHub. This results
in numerous custom tracking solutions that may not be technically sound or
compliant. The goal of this project is to establish a standardized and compliant
method for solution developers to track usage data on external solutions.

## Solution
Provide a standardized way to track solution usage data in a compliant and easy
way. Minimize the time needed to introduce necessary tracking in open source
solutions. Capture solution usage metrics to track impact and guide solution
